## Setup Instructions

**1. Clone the Repository**  
You will need to clone the bots repository and then change to the cloned repository so you can make the changes needed.
- Clone the bot's repository: `git clone https://github.com/cannomaly/my-bots.git`
- Change to the cloned repo `cd <bot-directory>`
- Run the command: `ls` or `ls -lh` to get a list of my discord bots.

**2. Install Dependencies**  
Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed. Set up a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies by running the following commands:
- Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv/bin/activate.fish` for fish shell.
- Install dependencies: `pip install discord.py python-dotenv openai`

**3. Set Up Environment Variables**  
Create a `.env` file the root directory of the project or edit the one included in my repo.
- Run `ls -lha` to see hidden files as .env is a hidden file.
- Edit the .env file like so: `vim .env` or `nano .env`
- Add your bot token to the file like so: `DISCORD_TOKEN_<BOT_NAME>=your_bot_token_here`

**4. Running the Bot**  
After setting up everything, you can run the bot with the following command:
- Activate your virtual environment (if not already active): `source venv/bin/activate`
- Run the bot: `python <bot-file>.py`

## Setting Up Each Bot as a Systemd Service
You can run each bot as a background service using systemd. Follow these steps to create and configure a systemd service for each bot.

**1. Create a systemd Service File**
For each bot, create a service file under `/etc/systemd/system/`. Replace `<bot-name>` with the appropriate bot name (e.g., `zeze`, `chewie`, `chomper`, or `freyja`).

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/<bot-name>.service
```

**2. Add the Following Configuration to the Service File**
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Discord Bot - <Bot-Name>
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/bot
ExecStart=/path/to/your/venv/bin/python /path/to/your/bot/<bot-file>.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**3. Reload systemd**
Once the service file is created, reload systemd to make the service available.
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

**4. Start the Bot Service**
Start the bot service with the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl start <bot-name>.service
```

**5. Enable the Bot Service to Start on Boot**
To ensure the bot starts automatically after a reboot, enable the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable <bot-name>.service
```

**6. Check the Status of the Service**
You can check the status of the bot service to ensure it's running correctly:
```bash
sudo systemctl status <bot-name>.service
```

**7. Stopping the Service**
To stop the bot service, use the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop <bot-name>.service
```

### Bot-Specific Setup Notes:

- **ZeZe**: Requires a channel ID for announcements. Update the `ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNEL_ID` in the script.
- **Chewie**: Requires proper role permissions for managing roles.
- **Chomper and Freyja**: Require OpenAI API keys in the environment variables for interacting with the OpenAI API.

## Permissions

All commands across the bots require administrator permissions to ensure only trusted users can execute critical actions.
